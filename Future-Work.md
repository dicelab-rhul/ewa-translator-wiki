# Future Work

The **web application** described in [Visualisation](./Visualisation) is currently under development. At present, the system can only be used via the **command line** on a compatible GNU/Linux system (see [Getting Started](./Getting-Started)).

## Planned Developments

1. **Web interface for broader accessibility**  
   - The forthcoming application will allow users, including those without programming or system administration expertise, to run the workflow directly through a browser.  
   - This will significantly lower the barrier to entry for researchers, particularly in Economics.  

2. **Enhanced usability**  
   - Simplified dataset upload and management.  
   - Output inspection and download through a graphical interface.  

3. **Scalability and integration**  
   - Support for processing multiple datasets simultaneously.  
   - Potential future integration with existing repositories of experimental Economics data.

## Purpose

The aim of these improvements is to make EWA Translator usable by a **wider community**, ensuring that experimental data can be translated, visualised, and shared with minimal technical overhead.
